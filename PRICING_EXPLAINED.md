## Why Your Moving Prices Fluctuate - Complete Guide for Clients

---

## Quick Answer: WHY ARE PRICES DIFFERENT?

Your moving quote changes based on **THREE main factors:**

1. **What You're Moving** (property size, contents, floor level, parking)
2. **Where You're Moving** (distance, collection/delivery location difficulty)
3. **When You're Moving** (date, day of week, advance booking)

---

## FACTOR 1️⃣: YOUR PROPERTY DETAILS (40-50% of price)

### A. Property Size
```
1-bedroom flat:     18m³ base
2-bedroom flat:     28m³ base
3-bedroom house:    40m³ base
4-bedroom house:    50m³ base
```
**Larger property = Higher cost** ✓

### B. How Much You're Moving
```
"A few things"      = 25% of property
"Half contents"     = 50% of property
"Three quarter"     = 75% of property
"Everything"        = 100% of property
```

**Moving less = Lower cost** ✓

### C. Additional Spaces
Add storage areas and get charged for them:
```
Shed:           +4m³
Loft:           +6m³
Basement:      +10m³
Single Garage:  +8m³
Double Garage: +15m³
```

**More spaces = Higher cost** ✓

---

## FACTOR 2️⃣: COLLECTION & DELIVERY LOCATION (30-40% of price)

This is where **most price variation** happens!

### Collection Point Assessment (Where we pick up)

**A. Parking Type**
```
✓ Driveway access       = No extra charge
✗ Roadside parking      = No extra charge
```

**B. Distance to Your Door**
```
< 10 meters         = Base price
10-20 meters        = +10% 
> 20 meters         = +15%
```

**C. Internal Access (Flats/Offices)**
```
Stairs only (4+ flights) = Base price
Lift access              = +2.5%
```

**D. Floor Level**
```
Ground floor     = Base price
1st floor        = +10%
2nd floor        = +15%
3rd+ floor       = +20%
```

### Combined Effect Example
```
Scenario A (Easiest):
- Driveway
- <10m walk
- Lift access
- Ground floor
TOTAL IMPACT: +2.5% (almost base price)

Scenario B (Hardest):
- Roadside parking
- >20m walk
- Stairs only
- 3rd floor
TOTAL IMPACT: +35% (much higher)
```

### Delivery Point Assessment
**Same factors applied to delivery location** - so prices change again!

---

## FACTOR 3️⃣: MOVE DATE & TIMING (20-30% of price)

### Notice Period (How far in advance you book)
```
Same day              = +50% EXPENSIVE 🔴
Within 3 days         = +30% expensive 🟡
Within 1 week         = +20% expensive 🟡
Within 2 weeks        = +10% expensive 🟡
Within 1 month        = Base price ✓
Over 1 month ahead    = -20% SAVES YOU MONEY 🟢
```

**Book in advance = Save 20%** ✓

### Day of Week
```
Sunday - Thursday = Standard price ✓
Friday - Saturday = +15% premium 🔴
```

**Weekday moves are cheaper** ✓

### Special Days
```
Bank Holidays    = +40-60% premium 🔴
School Holidays  = +20-30% premium 🟡
High Demand Days = +30% premium 🔴
```

**Avoid holidays = Save money** ✓

---

## FACTOR 4️⃣: OPTIONAL SERVICES (10-20% of price)

### Packing
```
Cost = 35% of your inventory cost
Example: £1,000 inventory × 35% = £350 packing
```

### Dismantling & Reassembly
```
Dismantling = £25 per m³
Reassembly  = £50 per m³

Example: For 18m³ flat:
Dismantling = 18 × £25 = £450
Reassembly  = 18 × £50 = £900
```

---

## FACTOR 5️⃣: COMPANY SELECTION (10-20% of price)

### Yes - Each Company Has Different Rates

Different moving companies charge different base rates:
```
Company A: £35/m³ for loading
Company B: £40/m³ for loading
Company C: £30/m³ for loading
```

**This is why we show you 20+ companies to compare!**

## 🧮 COMPLETE PRICING FORMULA

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         FINAL PRICE CALCULATION                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

STEP 1: Base Inventory Cost
────────────────────────────
Volume m³ × Company's Loading Rate
= 18m³ × £35/m³ = £630

STEP 2: Apply Location Difficulty
─────────────────────────────────
× Collection Multiplier (1.0 to 1.35)
× Delivery Multiplier   (1.0 to 1.35)
= £630 × 1.10 × 1.15 = £793

STEP 3: Add Mileage
──────────────────
+ (Distance × Volume × Cost per Mile)
= (28.3 miles × 18m³ × £0.25) = £127

STEP 4: Add Optional Extras
───────────────────────────
+ Packing (35% of inventory): £278
+ Dismantling (£25/m³):       £450
+ Reassembly (£50/m³):        £900

SUBTOTAL = £793 + £127 + £278 + £450 + £900 = £2,548

STEP 5: Apply Booking Timing Discount/Premium
──────────────────────────────────────────────
× Notice Period Multiplier (0.8 to 1.5)
× Day of Week Multiplier   (1.0 or 1.15)
× Holiday Multiplier       (1.0 to 1.6)

FINAL PRICE = £2,548 × 0.9 (month advance) = £2,293

## 🤔 IS IT THE COMPANY'S PRICING?

### YES & NO - Here's How It Works:

### Part 1: Company Base Rates (Their Choice)
```
Each moving company sets their own:
- Loading cost per m³
- Assembly/disassembly rates
- Mileage charges

This is 40% of the final price variation.
```

### Part 2: System Multipliers (Our System)
```
All companies are subject to the same:
- Location difficulty multipliers
- Booking timing discounts/premiums
- Holiday surcharges
- Demand pricing

This is 60% of the final price variation.
```

### Example
```
Company A charges £35/m³ for loading
Company B charges £40/m³ for loading

But BOTH apply:
- +20% for 3rd floor delivery
- -20% discount for 1 month advance booking
- +50% premium if booked same day
```
